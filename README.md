# Best-Sluggers-of-All-Time
Who are the greatest baseball sluggers of all time?
This paper examines how the index 'HR/AB per Season' of the 42 players topping the all-time HR list behaved when compared against
the mean of the 'HR/AB per Season' of all players. Furthermore, it was weighted this index using the strength of the players, considering
that the stronger the player and the weaker the players which whom he played with, would have more favorable opportunities to excel above
the mean of each Season.
