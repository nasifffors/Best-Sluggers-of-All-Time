# Best-Sluggers-of-All-Time
Who are the greatest baseball sluggers of all time?
This paper examines how the index 'HR/AB per Season' of the 42 sluggers topping the all-time HR list behaved when compared against
the mean of the 'HR/AB per Season' of each of the Seasons played by these sluggers. Furthermore, it was weighted this index using the
strength of the sluggers, considering that the stronger the slugger and the weaker the other players which whom he played with, would
have more favorable opportunities to excel above the mean of each Season.
